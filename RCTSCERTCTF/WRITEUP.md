### Solution

First, the challenge asked me to find out the model who is made up by the red brushes on the wall.

I was give a chance by use Google Image but it don't like what I expected. The challenge name is a hint which help me to locate where store is. I then use the keyword "Victoria Secret in Lisbon" and surf 7749 times in Google Image to find the store and the model graphic next to :>>. Finally, I have found out a image which look like up to 90% the attached image.
